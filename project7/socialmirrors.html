            <h1>Social Mirrors</h1>
            <p>In this series, I examine society and identity through art, using visual storytelling to highlight
                stereotypes, racism, and cultural norms. Humor and irony invite the viewer to engage with the work while
                encouraging thoughtful reflection on these complex issues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Media:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Inspired by the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover,' this work
                        explores lookism---prejudice based on appearance. As someone who has struggled with low
                        self-esteem, I reflect on unconscious self-criticism and judgment. The idea emerged while dining
                        with a friend who rejected cherry tomatoes as 'ugly' while admiring marbled meat. Her
                        personification of foods based on looks became the foundation for this project.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Living alone, I often turned to snacks instead of proper
                        meals---chocolates, jellies, candies, and gum. Snacks such as salty and sweet snacks and gum did
                        not satisfy all the nutrients in my body, but I always had to put them next to me to help even a
                        little. Piled around my room, they began to resemble buildings, forming a strange city of sugar
                        and salt. In Obe-city, I painted this landscape as an observational work, placing a Lego man
                        transformed into an obese figure The piece mirrors both my personal habits and a broader
                        reflection on how modern society builds its own "cities" out of consumption.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This work imagines three playful ways to take revenge on a hateful
                        boss. Living as an employee in this competitive and hierarchical society, I believe everyone has
                        likely dreamed of pranks or revenge, and here I turn those private fantasies into visual form.
                        With humor and exaggeration, I remind the audience that imagination can be a space of freedom,
                        where even the most powerless moments can be reclaimed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Media:</strong> Korean traditional sauces, assorted sauces on canvas, Pen</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Inspired by Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus, where animals embody
                        racial hierarchies, I turned to animal allegory to express my own experiences of isolation as an
                        Asian living abroad. I painted myself as a vulnerable rabbit surrounded by wolves, symbolizing
                        the predator-prey relationship I felt in foreign groups. Instead of paint, I used real
                        sauces---Korean chili paste, bean paste, and kimchi soup for myself, and ketchup, mustard,
                        barbecue, and peanut sauce for the wolves---transforming food into metaphor. These choices
                        reflect how I was often singled out, even teased for "smelling like kimchi," and became a way to
                        reclaim that memory through a vivid, tactile language of identity and difference.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Coral reefs protect coastlines and offer shelter to countless
                        creatures, and I imagined my mother in the same way---someone who embraces and shields me. To
                        symbolize this, I crafted a coral form out of my mom's clothes and everyday items like
                        dish-washing gloves, carrying with them the familiar scent and warmth of her presence. This work
                        became both a metaphor and a gift: something my parents can look at when they miss me,
                        especially as I prepare to leave for college in the United States.</p>

                    <p><strong>Media:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Since I moved to four different regions, I've always wondered where
                        I belong. I got attention in the Philippines just because I had an "Asian look," and in the
                        U.S., I have been finger-pointed and cursed at for no reason. And even in Korea, just because my
                        pronunciation was a bit off, I was easily pointed. I thought my identity was confusing as I
                        wasn't welcomed in any region. Without realizing it, I pretended to be happy and okay in front
                        of others and lonely and depressed at home alone. I tried to express the confused inner
                        self-holding an artificial mask to show how I felt.</p>
