        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>My name is Jibin Han, and I am from South Korea.
            I am a sophomore majoring in Applied Data Analytics at Syracuse University. </p>
        <p> I chose my major to Applied Data Analytics as I am interested in using data to solve real-world problems.
            Since coming to SU, I have been on the Dean’s List every semester, which reflects my academic commitment.
        </p>
        <p>Over the summer break, I completed an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course on Coursera Plus and
            earned both a certificate and a badge.
            This semester, I am further developing my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data visualization,
            with the goal of applying these tools to future projects that will strengthen my resume.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new foods, playing detective board games that challenge my
            problem-solving skills.
            Also, I am a thrill-seeker and I seek thrills on exciting rides.
            I relieve stress by rides like “pirate ship” and “Gyro Drop”, and although I have only been to the New York
            State Fair so far, I hope to visit a Six Flags Park soon to experience more spine-chilling rides.
        </p>
