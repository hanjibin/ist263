            <h1>Inner Landscapes: Cellular Worlds</h1>
            <p>This series explores how the invisible processes inside the body and my understandings of cellular
                biology can become a metaphor for personal experience. You can enjoy my biological imagery to
                communicate my emotional and physical journey.</p>

                            <p><strong>Media:</strong> Acrylic paint, Clay, Papers, Slime</p>
                            <p><strong>Size:</strong> 4.5 (H) x 8.25 (W) x 6.5 (D) in</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cellkoyaki is a word I created by combining "cells" and
                                "takoyaki." Takoyaki has always been my soul food. It was something my parents often
                                ordered for me when I was home alone after school. I would sit there, waiting for them
                                to return, eating a whole box by myself. At the same time, my fascination with biology
                                led me to repeatedly draw and craft the shapes of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells,
                                until they felt like friendly, hand-made toys. Merging these two nostalgic parts of my
                                life, I came up with "Cellkoyaki"---a playful blend of memory, food, and science.</p>

                            <p><strong>Media:</strong> Shoe, Acrylic paints, Clay</p>
                            <p><strong>Size:</strong> 10 (H) x 3.75 (W) x 3.5 (D) in</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I transformed a shoe into a mouth part of discomfort,
                                turning the tongue into a realistic clay tongue marked with canker sores. On the outer
                                surface, I added painful pimples to evoke a sense of disturbance and unease. For me,
                                stomatitis often appears when I'm tired, and the pain is both sharp and irritating. I
                                wanted to symbolize my exhaustion and fatigue by exposing both the inner and outer
                                mouth. I was also struck by the idea that a "shoe tongue" shares its name with the human
                                tongue. Through this piece, I wanted to share that sensation, inviting the audience to
                                feel empathy for these small but intense moments of the body's vulnerability.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I sketched myself in five poses, outlined in white against
                                the black paper, as if tracing moments of my own presence. My limbs are colored in
                                shades of blue and green, while my face and body are warmed with yellows, reds, and
                                purples. The contrast mirrors what I live with: even in summer, my hands and feet stay
                                cold, and when winter comes, it is unbearable.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This piece reflects my focus on the sound of my own
                                heartbeat, where even the smallest change made me anxious. During one of the most
                                difficult times in my life---when I was diagnosed with hypokalemia and arrhythmia---I
                                created a headphone that allowed me to listen to my heart and kidney sounds, as if I
                                could detect any error within my body. This vividly capture the most nervous and
                                challenging moment in my life.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this work, I transform the microscopic world of soil
                                into a tangible experience. Inspired by an egg-shaped lampshade from the Bird's Special
                                Collection and the hidden life of prokaryotes, I created an oval structure representing
                                a single cell. Using coffee filters to capture and filter soil samples, I painted
                                delicate watercolors on them to reveal the unseen beauty of these tiny organisms. The
                                black face mask on the "flagellum" hints at their impact on humans, blending science and
                                art in a tangible, thought-provoking form.</p>
