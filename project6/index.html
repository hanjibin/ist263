                    <h3>Artist Words:</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to my online exhibition. My name is Jibin Han, and I am majoring in Applied Data Analytics from Syracuse University. Surprisingly, I have been exploring art as a way of telling dynamic stories and my point of view since I was young. My artwork reflects my personal journey, my struggles, and my point of view against social issues. Through drawing, painting and 3D works, I transform both my experiences and my imagination into visual narratives.</p>

                    <p>After being diagnosed with hypokalemia, I explored my symptoms through art. In one of my work "Hypochondriac/Illness Anxiety Disorder," I sculpted a heart and kidney with clay on a actual headphone to focus on the sounds of my body and detect irregular heartbeat changes while capturing the moments of fear and tension I had to feel. I also have video performance for this to vividly share the moments I went through.</p>

                    <p>Another work. "Cellkoyaki," is a sculpture that combines my eukaryotic cell and takoyaki, my favorite food. Observing the round shapes of eukaryotic cells, I recreated them in Takoyaki form to deliver a playful and distinctive interpretation, giving each "Cellkoyaki" its own flavor and personality.</p>

                    <p>Through these works and the rest of the exhibition, I invite you to explore how invisible biological processes, personal experiences and imagination can intersect in art.</p>
