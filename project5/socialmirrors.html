        <h1>Social Mirrors</h1>

        <section>
            <p>In this series, I examine society and identity through art, using visual storytelling to highlight
                stereotypes, racism, and cultural norms. Humor and irony invite the viewer to engage with the work while
                encouraging thoughtful reflection on these complex issues.</p>

            <h2>Selected Works:</h2>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Inspired by the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover,' this work
                explores lookism---prejudice based on appearance. As someone who has struggled with low self-esteem, I
                reflect on unconscious self-criticism and judgment. The idea emerged while dining with a friend who
                rejected cherry tomatoes as 'ugly' while admiring marbled meat. Her personification of foods based on
                looks became the foundation for this project.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Living alone, I often turned to snacks instead of proper meals like
                chocolates, jellies, candies, and gum. Snacks such as salty and sweet snacks and gum did not satisfy all
                the nutrients in my body, but I always had to put them next to me to help even a little. Piled around my
                room, they began to resemble buildings, forming a strange city of sugar and salt. In Obe-city, I painted
                this landscape as an observational work, placing a Lego man transformed into an obese figure The piece
                mirrors both my personal habits and a broader reflection on how modern society builds its own "cities"
                out of consumption.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This work imagines three playful ways to take revenge on a hateful boss
                Living as an employer in this competitive and hierarchical society, I believe everyone has likely
                dreamed of pranks or revenge, and here I turn those private fantasies into visual form. With humor and
                exaggeration, I remind the audience that imagination can be a space of freedom, where even the most
                powerless moments can be reclaimed.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Inspired by Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus, where animals embody racial
                hierarchies, I turned to animal allegory to express my own experiences of isolation as an Asian living
                abroad. I painted myself as a vulnerable rabbit surrounded by wolves, symbolizing the predator-prey
                relationship I felt in foreign groups. Instead of paint, I used real sauces---Korean chili paste, bean
                paste, and kimchi soup for myself, and ketchup, mustard, barbecue, and peanut sauce for the
                wolves---transforming food into metaphor. These choices reflect how I was often singled out, even teased
                for "smelling like kimchi," and became a way to reclaim that memory through a vivid, tactile language of
                identity and difference.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Coral reefs protect coastlines and offer shelter to countless creatures,
                and I imagined my mother in the same way. A someone who embraces and shields me. To symbolize this, I
                crafted a coral form out of my mom's clothes and everyday items like dish-washing gloves, carrying with
                them the familiar scent and warmth of her presence. This work became both a metaphor and a gift:
                something my parents can look at when they miss me, especially as I prepare to leave for college in the
                United States.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Since I moved to four different regions, I've always wondered where I
                belong. I got attention in the Philippines just because I had an "Asian look," and in the U.S., I have
                been finger-pointed and cursed at for no reason. And even in Korea, just because my pronunciation was a
                bit off, I was easily pointed. I thought my identity was confusing as I wasn't welcomed in any region.
                Without realizing it, I pretended to be happy and okay in front of others and lonely and depressed at
                home alone. I tried to express the confused inner self-holding an artificial mask to show how I felt.
