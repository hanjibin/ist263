        <h1>Inner Landscapes: Cellular Worlds</h1>

        <section>
            <p>This series explores how the invisible processes inside the body and my understandings of cellular
                biology can become a metaphor for personal experience. You can enjoy my biological imagery to
                communicate my emotional and physical journey.</p>

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cellkoyaki is a word I created by combining "cells" and "takoyaki."
                    Takoyaki has always been my soul food. It was something my parents often ordered for me when I was
                    home alone after school. I would sit there, waiting for them to return, eating a whole box by
                    myself. At the same time, my fascination with biology led me to repeatedly draw and craft the shapes
                    of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, until they felt like friendly, hand-made toys. Merging these
                    two nostalgic parts of my life, I came up with "Cellkoyaki"---a playful blend of memory, food, and
                    science.</p>

                <figcaption>
                    <br><strong>Stomatitis (2021)</strong><br>
                    <strong>Media:</strong> Shoe, Acrylic paints, Clay<br>
                    <strong>Size:</strong> 10 (H) x 3.75 (W) x 3.5 (D) in
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I transformed a shoe into a mouth part of discomfort, turning the tongue
                into a realistic clay tongue marked with canker sores. On the outer surface, I added painful pimples to
                evoke a sense of disturbance and unease. For me, stomatitis often appears when I'm tired, and the pain
                is both sharp and irritating. I wanted to symbolize my exhaustion and fatigue by exposing both the inner
                and outer mouth. I was also struck by the idea that a "shoe tongue" shares its name with the human
                tongue. Through this piece, I wanted to share that sensation, inviting the audience to feel empathy for
                these small but intense moments of the body's vulnerability.</p>

                <figcaption>
                    <br><strong>Cold Extremities (2021)</strong><br>
                    <strong>Media:</strong> Color pencils on black colored paper<br>
                    <strong>Size:</strong> 15.3 (H) x 21.2 (W) in
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I sketched myself in five poses, outlined in white against the black paper,
                as if tracing moments of my own presence. My limbs are colored in shades of blue and green, while my
                face and body are warmed with yellows, reds, and purples. The contrast mirrors what I live with: even in
                summer, my hands and feet stay cold, and when winter comes, it is unbearable.</p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This piece reflects my focus on the sound of my own heartbeat, where even
                the smallest change made me anxious. During one of the most difficult times in my life---when I was
                diagnosed with hypokalemia and arrhythmia---I created a headphone that allowed me to listen to my heart
                and kidney sounds, as if I could detect any error within my body. This vividly capture the most nervous
                and challenging moment in my life.</p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I observed that the trunk of an elephant and the tentacle of an octopus
                shows similar movement and function when grabbing something. Then, I found it interesting to replace
                elephant's trunk with an octopus leg.</p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this work, I transform the microscopic world of soil into a tangible
                experience. Inspired by an egg-shaped lampshade from the Bird's Special Collection and the hidden life
                of prokaryotes, I created an oval structure representing a single cell. Using coffee filters to capture
                and filter soil samples, I painted delicate watercolors on them to reveal the unseen beauty of these
                tiny organisms. The black face mask on the "flagellum" hints at their impact on humans, blending science
                and art in a tangible, thought-provoking form.</p>
