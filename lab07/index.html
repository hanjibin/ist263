    <h1> Jibin Han's Biography </h1>

    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>My name is Jibin Han, and I am from South Korea. 
    I am a sophomore majoring in Applied Data Analytics at Syracuse University. </p>
    <p> I chose my major to Applied Data Analytics as I am interested in using data to solve real-world problems.
    Since coming to SU, I have been on the Dean’s List every semester, which reflects my academic commitment. </p>
    Over the summer break, I completed an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course on Coursera Plus and earned both a certificate and a badge.
    This semester, I am further developing my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data visualization, with the goal of applying these tools to future projects that will strengthen my resume.
    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new foods, playing detective board games that challenge my problem-solving skills.
    Also, I am a thrill-seeker and I seek thrills on exciting rides.
    I relieve stress by rides like “pirate ship” and “Gyro Drop”, and although I have only been to the New York State Fair so far, I hope to visit a Six Flags Park soon to experience more spine-chilling rides.
    </p>
